      <h1> About Lara Chu </h1>
      <p> Hi! My name is Lara Chu and I'm currently a third-year UC Berkeley student,
        majoring in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. I was born and raised
        in Portland, Oregon but now live in San Jose, California and I have two older
        sisters. I'm currently working as a Student Web Developer for the Berkeley
        Law School and I'm excited to learn and have hands-on experience with new technologies!
      </p>
      <h2> Involvements </h2>
      <p> Some things I have been involved with on campus: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> EthiCal Apparel - Senior Marketing Associate </li>
        <li> The Berkeley Project - Web Committee </li>
        <li> Theta Tau Co-Ed Engineering Fraternity - Treasurer </li>
        <li> AFX Dance </li>
      </ul>
    <h3> Hobbies </h3>
    <p> In my free time I like hiking, traveling, watching movies, and cooking! Last summer I traveled
      to Spain and France, and you can check out my vlog of the trip

    <h3> Bucket List </h3>
    <p> I really value having new experiences and since I have only 1 more year
    at Berkeley, here's a little bucket list/to-do list before I graduate! </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Go to a Six Flags with friends (I've never been to one before and I love
        roller coasters) </li>
      <li> Climb Doe Library </li>
      <li> Go on a spontaneous trip in the middle of the week </li>
    </ol>
